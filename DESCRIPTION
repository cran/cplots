Description: Provides functions to produce some circular plots for circular data, in a height- or area-proportional manner. They include barplots, smooth density plots, stacked dot plots, histograms, multi-class stacked smooth density plots, and multi-class stacked histograms. The new methodology for general area-proportional circular visualization is described in an article submitted (after revision) to Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics.
